# mda-project-template
This repository is a mini data analysis project that I am working on to practice using the *tidyverse* packages to analyze and visualize data. In the first analysis, I will be mainly focusing on using *dplyr* and *ggplot2*. In the second analysis, I will mainly be focused on analyzing tidy data and fitting a model object to my data.

Each section of the mini-analysis project will have comments on my thought process to orient anyone who reads it. It will walk you through the packages needed to run the code, the learning objectives, the dataset I have chosen, and the graphs that I made to explore the dataset. You can run the code in RStudio to visualize the graphs or view them through the md file that is in this respository.
